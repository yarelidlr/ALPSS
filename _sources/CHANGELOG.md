## [Unreleased]

## [1.7.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- Velocity phase now computes and tracks uncertainty (`velocity_ok` flag)
  - Velocity thresholds now required in config and properly enforced
- New shock analysis phase computing peak shock stress
- Phase status display with color coding on main output figure
- Enhanced config validation module with strict parameter checking and mode-based requirements
- New incompatibility check: HEL detection incompatible with gaussian_notch filter

### Changed
- **Major refactor**: Decoupled uncertainty analysis from spall phase; now runs independently
- Renamed config parameters: `spall_calculation` → `spall_enabled`, `hel_calculation` → `hel_enabled`
- Reorganized config structure for better clarity and validation
- Reorganized results output: velocity uncertainties moved to velocity phase, spall/shock/HEL results in their respective sections
- Improved error handling with per-phase error tracking and display on plots
- Pipeline phases now run independently with graceful degradation to NaN on failure
- Restructured internal phase orchestration in `utils/phases.py` for cleaner separation of concerns
- Reorganized modules structure for more readibility and practicality

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- `velocity_ok`, `spall_ok`, and `uncertainty_ok` flags in output, with per-category error messages

### Fixed
- Clamp `time_start_idx - pad` to valid range and use `np.pad(..., mode="edge")` to prevent empty arrays when signal starts near the beginning of data
- Removed internal try/except from `spall_analysis` so real exceptions surface to `alpss_main`
- Uncertainty analysis is now skipped when spall fails, preventing misleading `uncertainty_ok=True` with NaN values
- Hard HEL failures (insufficient data) raise; soft failures (no plateau) return `HELResult(ok=False, error_message=...)`
- HEL diagnostic figure is now saved via `save()` and returned in the assets dict

### Changed
- Reduced legend font size for "Voltage Data" and "Velocity with Uncertainty Bounds" plots
- Improved informational logging throughout the pipeline

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- Hugoniot Elastic Limit (HEL) detection module (`alpss.analysis.hel`)
  - `hel_detection()` — gradient-based plateau detection with configurable thresholds
  - `elastic_shock_strain_rate()` — elastic strain rate calculation
  - `HELResult` dataclass with typed fields for all detection outputs
- HEL diagnostic plotting (`alpss.plotting.hel.plot_hel_detection`)
  - 3-panel figure: full trace, zoomed plateau, gradient analysis
- HEL integrated into `alpss_main` pipeline as optional Phase 2b
  - Enabled via `hel_detection_enabled=True` in inputs
  - HEL results included in saved output CSV when detected
- Unit tests for HEL detection and strain rate calculation

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-11

### Changed
- Reorganized codebase from flat layout to modular package structure under `src/alpss/`
- Moved carrier frequency and filter logic into `alpss.carrier` subpackage
- Moved spall and uncertainty analysis into `alpss.analysis` subpackage
- Moved velocity calculation into `alpss.velocity` subpackage
- Moved plotting into `alpss.plotting` subpackage
- Moved I/O and saving into `alpss.io` subpackage
- Moved detection logic into `alpss.detection` subpackage
- Moved shared utilities (`extract_data`, `stft`) into `alpss.utils`

### Added
- CLI entry points: `alpss` and `alpss-watch` commands
- Backward-compatible re-exports in `alpss.__init__` for existing user code
- Dynamic versioning via `poetry-dynamic-versioning` (git tag is single source of truth)
- `__version__` attribute exposed on the `alpss` package
- CI workflow for running tests on PRs and pushes to main
- Unified release workflow (test → PyPI → Docker → GitHub Release)
- `CHANGELOG.md` for tracking release history
- Changelog page in Jupyter Book documentation

### Fixed
- Dockerfile now pins the exact released version instead of using `--pre`

### Removed
- Old flat-layout module files (replaced by subpackage structure)

## [1.3.2] - 2024-12-01

### Changed
- Maintenance release with minor bug fixes and dependency updates

## [1.2.4] - 2024-05-01

### Added
- Time-resolved uncertainty estimates for velocity traces
- Automated spall signal analysis pipeline
- Initial PyPI and Docker publishing workflows
